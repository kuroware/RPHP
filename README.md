This is a framework I've been using for a few side projects and I wanted to develop it a bit further. It currently supports:
<ul>
<li>Bionomial Distribution</li>
<li>ExponentialDistribution</li>
<li>Discrete Random Variable</li>
<li>Poisson Distribution</li>
</ul>
And I'm currently working on Gamma and Normal to avoid approximiations
